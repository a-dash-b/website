    <h1>Akhil Bhardwaj</h1>
    <p><a href="nav.html">navigate</a></p>
    <p>I'm currently a PGP student at ISB Hyderabad, where I've discovered my passions for AI and marketing. I've also won a few case competitions along the way, which has been pretty exciting! When I'm not buried in coursework, I'm probably thinking about product strategy or exploring how technology can solve real business problems.</p>
    
    <p>Starting soon, I'll be a Product Associate at BCG X, where I'll help clients build digital products and ventures internally. I'm looking forward to combining strategy with hands-on product work.</p>

    <p>I'd especially love to hear from you if you want to talk about consulting, product, AI, or just swap stories about interesting projects you're working on!</p>
    
    <h2>What I've Been Up To</h2>
    
    <p>Before ISB, I spent a couple of years as an Associate Consultant at Capitel, working on digital infrastructure deals worth over $10B with funds like KKR and Blackstone. I built AI forecast models, developed strategies for telcos and data centers, and got an early promotion for leading some mission-critical workstreams. It was intense but taught me a ton about how big deals actually work.</p>
    
    <p>In 2024, I did some short-term consulting with Positive Moves, helping shape their aerospace and defense strategies in India. Between consulting gigs, I also ran <a href="https://launchspaceunbox.com" target="_blank">UNBOX</a> with my parents (2022-2025) – we created board and card games, which was a completely different kind of challenge but incredibly fun while it lasted.</p>
